-- A longer description of the package.
description:
    This is the core package for [heftia-effects](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/heftia-effects).
    .
    Heftia is an extensible effects library that generalizes "Algebraic Effects and Handlers" to higher-order effects, providing users with maximum flexibility and delivering standard and reasonable speed.
    In its generalization, the focus is on ensuring predictable results based on simple, consistent semantics, while preserving soundness.
    .
    Please refer to the [Haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/heftia-0.5.0.0/docs/Control-Monad-Hefty.html) for usage and semantics.
    For information on performance, please refer to [performance.md](https://github.com/sayo-hs/heftia/blob/v0.5.0/benchmark/performance.md).
    .
    This library is inspired by the paper:
    .
    * Casper Bach Poulsen and Cas van der Rest. 2023. Hefty Algebras: Modular
        Elaboration of Higher-Order Algebraic Effects. Proc. ACM Program. Lang. 7,
        POPL, Article 62 (January 2023), 31 pages. <https://doi.org/10.1145/3571255>
    .
    The /elaboration/ approach proposed in the above paper allows for a straightforward treatment of higher-order effects.
    .
    Heftia's data structure is an extension of the Freer monad, designed to be theoretically straightforward by eliminating ad-hoc elements.
